## 1. Introduction
<p>Welcome to the code challenges, here you can find different exercises that will require the best of you, meditate on the problem, try to divide it into sub-problems, create an idea and until then start programming. Remember that the most important thing is to learn in the process. We wish you the best.</p>

## 2. Requirements
<p>To test your challanges you will nedd to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), this is because we are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to make automated tests, so you can try your solutions faster. In every challange wi will explain you how you can make use of the automated test to try your solution.</p>

## 3. Getting Started
<p>First you need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">fork this repository</a>. After forking the repository in your computer using the terminal or cli get inside the repository and run: <b><i>npm install</i></b>, this will configure all settings to test your responses. Then inside the folder with the name <b><i>challenges</i></b>, you will find the challenges, and inside every folder of a challenge you will need to create a folder with the name: <b>YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME</b> where you will submit your solution to the challenge. To test your solution you can use the <b><i>solution.js</i></b> file, placing your code and running the respective command for the challanges, the respective commands will be listed in the `README.md` file in each challange.</p>,
